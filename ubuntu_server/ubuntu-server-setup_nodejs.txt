########################
I.	LOGIN AND FIREWALL
########################

Root user login via ssh keys or password.

1.	Add user and set sudo privileges:

adduser <user>
usermod -aG sudo <user>	
//-> -a for append, -G for list of groups, adds the user to the group "sudo" which is configured for admin priviliges

UFW FIREWALL

Once enabled blocks access to all services, unless specified otherwise. 

ufw app list
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw enable
ufw status

PUBLIC KEY
Grant user access via public key. The public key is already in the root account’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server, we can copy that file and directory structure to our new user account in our existing session:

rsync --archive --chown=<user>:<user> ~/.ssh /home/<user>

INSTALL

First, install the NodeSource PPA in order to get access to its contents. Make sure you’re in your home directory, and use curl to retrieve the installation script for the Node.js 8.x archives:

cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x -o nodesource_setup.sh

sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
nodejs -v

In order for some npm packages to work (those that require compiling code from source, for example), you will need to install the build-essential package:

sudo apt install build-essential


APP SETUP

Install your packages first with package.json

npm install --production


#########################
IV.	PM2 PROCESS MANAGER
#########################

PM2, a process manager for Node.js applications. PM2 makes it possible to daemonize applications so that they will run in the background as a service.

sudo npm install pm2@latest -g

PM2 automatically assigns an App name (based on the filename, without the .js extension) and a PM2 id. PM2 also maintains other information, such as the PID of the process, its current status, and memory usage.

pm2 start <app>.js
pm2 status
pm2 list
pm2 info <app>
pm2 monit
pm2 restart <process-name>

Applications that are running under PM2 will be restarted automatically if the application crashes or is killed.

To also load on system startup:

pm2 startup systemd

Run the command from the output, with your username in place of SAMMY:

sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u sammy --hp /home/sammy

pm2 save

As an additional step, we can save the PM2 process list and corresponding environments.

Once you have created a systemd unit that runs pm2 for your user on boot. This pm2 instance, in turn, runs <app>.js.


############################
V.	NGINX AS REVERSE PROXY
############################

Once the app is running and listening on localhost, you need to set up a way for your users to access it. Set up the Nginx web server as a reverse proxy for this purpose.

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	}
This configures the server to respond to requests at its root. Assuming our server is available at example.com, accessing https://example.com/ via a web browser would send the request to hello.js, listening on port 3000 at localhost.

You can add additional location blocks to the same server block to provide access to other applications on the same server. 

For example, if you were also running another Node.js application on port 3001, you could add this location block to allow access to it via https://example.com/app2:

    location /app2 {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
		...
    }


#############
VI.	ENV VAR
#############

When running multiple apps in one nodejs env, there is an issue with the .env files. Basically all apps are running in the same nodejs environment, thus there can be only one ENV file?
